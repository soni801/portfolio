  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>Hi! My name is Samuel, and I go by the username Soni online. I studied IT and media production at Amalie Skram VGS
    in Bergen, Norway during 2020-2022. I now work full-time as an IT technician at Høgskulen på Vestlandet.</p>
  <p>I got introduced to programming around 2016 and did block programming for some time before learning web
    development. After doing that for a while, I also started writing Java. I now have knowledge in several programming,
    scripting and markup languages.</p>
  <p>My interests heavily revolve around computers and include programming, digital media production and gaming. I also
    have interests and hobbies outside computers, like speedcubing. I mostly spend my available time doing light design
    or programming with my girlfriend.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>I've worked with web and frontend development for several years, and I also have significant knowledge regarding
    backend development. I have also done game design and development, in addition to a bit of graphic design.</p>
  <p>I can do frontend and backend web development, game development, mobile and desktop app design and development,
    logo design, general branding, color grading and video editing. If you want to discuss a business opportunity, feel
    free to <a routerLink="/contact">contact me</a>.</p>
